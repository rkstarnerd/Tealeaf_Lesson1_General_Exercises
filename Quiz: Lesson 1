1. What is the value of a after the below code is executed?


  a = 1
  b = a
  b = 3

  Answer: 1

2. What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

  Answer: An array is a collection or list that is indexed by integers.  A hash is a collection of key-value pairs that can be indexed by any type of key or symbol.


3. Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:

arr = [1, 2, 3, 3] # => [1, 2, 3, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq  # => [1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq! # => [1, 2, 3]

4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

  Answer: The map method performs the block for every element and returns an array.  The select method only puts elements in a new array that returns true.

  array = cards.map {|e| e[1]}

  array.select { |e| e[1] == 'Ace'}.count.times do
    total -= 10 if total > 21
  end

5. Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

  Answer: hash = { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3}

6. What is returned?


  x = 1

  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

  Answer: "no way!"

7. What is x?


  x = 1

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end
